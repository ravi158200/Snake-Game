Nice — here’s a compact but complete description of how the classic Snake game works, plus a ready-to-run Python implementation (using pygame) and notes on how it’s structured and how you can extend it.


🐍 Snake Game – Description

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a continuously moving snake inside a box or grid. The goal is to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions.

How It Works

The game starts with a small snake placed on the screen.

The snake moves automatically in one direction (up, down, left, or right).

The player controls the snake’s movement using arrow keys.

A piece of food appears at a random position.

When the snake’s head touches the food:

The snake grows longer

The player’s score increases

New food appears in another random spot

The game ends if:

The snake hits the wall

The snake collides with its own body

Objective

Survive as long as possible and get the highest score by eating food and avoiding collisions.

Main Game Features

Continuous movement of the snake

Random food placement

Score tracking

Increasing difficulty as snake grows longer

Collision detection (walls + self-hit)

Why the Game is Popular

Simple rules

Addictive gameplay

Easy to build for beginners (great Python project)

Many upgrade possibilities (levels, speed, obstacles)
